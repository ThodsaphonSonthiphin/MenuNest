# 🍽️ MenuNest

Family meal-planning web app — build a recipe library, track pantry stock, plan daily meals, and see what you need to buy when stock runs low.

**Domain:** menunest.app

---

## Features (MVP)

- 🔐 Sign in with Microsoft Entra ID (work, school, or personal account)
- 👪 Family management — create a family, invite members with a code, set relationships between members
- 🧂 Ingredient master — per-family list with autocomplete and on-the-fly creation
- 📖 Recipe library — store recipes with photos and ingredient quantities
- 📦 Stock — manually track what you have on hand
- 📅 Meal plan — plan meals by day × slot (breakfast / lunch / dinner)
- ✅ Stock check — compare a recipe against current stock and report what's missing
- 🍳 Cook action — one click on a planned meal deducts ingredients from stock automatically (clamped at zero; partial deductions allowed with a warning)
- 🛒 Shopping list — persistent lists you can build manually or auto-generate from meal plans; checking an item as bought adds it to stock automatically

## Tech Stack

### Frontend — `frontend/`
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Redux Toolkit (RTK + RTK Query) — state and API client
- React Router v6
- MSAL.js (`@azure/msal-react`) — Entra ID authentication
- Syncfusion (Community License) — Grid, Schedule, inputs
- Pattern: page-scoped folders (`pages/{feature}/{components,hooks,api,slice}`) with a component-plus-hook style

### Backend — `backend/`
- ASP.NET 10 (LTS) Clean Architecture
- EF Core 10 with the SQL Server provider (Azure SQL)
- `Mediator` (martinothamar) — CQRS with pipeline behaviors
- `FluentValidation` — request validation
- `Mapster` — DTO mapping
- `Microsoft.Identity.Web` — JWT bearer auth (multi-tenant + personal accounts)
- `Azure.Storage.Blobs` — recipe image storage
- Serilog + Application Insights

### Infra — `infra/`
- Azure App Service (backend)
- Azure Static Web Apps (frontend)
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Storage Account (blob container: `recipe-images`)
- Application Insights
- Azure App Registration (Entra ID — multi-tenant + personal)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- .NET 10 SDK
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Azure SQL, SQL Server LocalDB, or a Docker SQL container
- Azurite (Blob Storage emulator) or an Azure Storage account
- An Azure App Registration (for Entra ID)

### Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update --project src/MenuNest.Infrastructure --startup-project src/MenuNest.WebApi
dotnet run --project src/MenuNest.WebApi
# → https://localhost:5001/swagger

# Frontend (in a separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

Copy `appsettings.Development.json.example` and `.env.example`, then fill in your own credentials.

## Deployment (Azure)

The app is split across two Azure services:

- **Frontend → Azure Static Web Apps.** Hosts the built `frontend/dist`.
  SPA routing and security headers live in
  [frontend/staticwebapp.config.json](frontend/staticwebapp.config.json).
  SWA's built-in `/.auth/*` endpoints are **not** used — auth is handled
  client-side by MSAL against Entra ID (needed for personal accounts).
- **Backend → Azure App Service (Linux, .NET 10).** Hosts the Web API,
  connects to Azure SQL and Blob Storage.

### Backend configuration (App Service → Application settings)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` | Azure SQL connection string (use Managed Identity where possible) |
| `AzureAd__ClientId` | Entra ID app client ID |
| `AzureAd__Audience` | `api://<api-app-id>` |
| `AzureBlob__ConnectionString` | Storage account connection string (or use Managed Identity) |
| `Cors__AllowedOrigins` | Comma-separated list including the SWA origin, e.g. `https://menunest.azurestaticapps.net,https://menunest.app` |

### Frontend configuration (SWA → Application settings / `.env.production`)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `VITE_MSAL_CLIENT_ID` | Entra ID app client ID |
| `VITE_MSAL_AUTHORITY` | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common` |
| `VITE_API_SCOPE` | `api://<api-app-id>/access_as_user` |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `https://menunest-api.azurewebsites.net` |
| `VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` | Your Syncfusion Community License key |

### Entra ID App Registration (one-time setup)

- Platform: **Single-page application** with redirect URIs for both
  `http://localhost:5173` (dev) and the production SWA URL.
- Expose an API scope `access_as_user`.
- Supported account types: **multi-tenant + personal Microsoft accounts**.
